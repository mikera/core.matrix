;; ==================================================================================
;; clojure.core.matrix API namespace
;;
;; This is the public API for clojure.core.matrix
;;
;; General handling of operations is as follows:
;;
;; 1. user calls public AI function defined in clojure.core.matrix
;; 2. clojure.core.matrix function delegates to a protocol for the appropriate function
;;    with protocols as defined in the clojure.core.matrix.protocols namespace. In most cases
;;    clojure.core.matrix will try to delagate as quickly as possible to the implementation.
;; 3. The underlying matrix implementation implements the protocol to handle the API
;;    function call
;; 4. It's up to the implementation to decide what to do then
;; 5. If the implementation does not understand one or more parameters, then it is
;;    expected to call the multimethod version in clojure.core.matrix.multimethods as this
;;    will allow an alternative implementation to be found via multiple dispatch
