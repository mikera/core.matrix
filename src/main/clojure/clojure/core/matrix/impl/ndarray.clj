;; ## Intro
;;
;; This is an implementation of strided N-Dimensional array (or NDArray
;; for short). The underlying structure is similar to NumPy's [1] [2]
;; Default striding scheme is row-major, as in C. It can be changed
;; explicitly or by using some operations.
;;
;; TODO: elaborate on strides and stride-modifying operations

;; ## The structure
;;
;; This type is identical to NumPy's. Strides are stored explicitly;
;; this allows to perform some operations like transposition or
;; broadcasting to be done on "strides" field alone, avoiding touching
;; the data itself.
;; In future, other memory layouts can be considered, such as Morton order.
;; TODO: try Morton order
;; TODO: consider adding "offset" field (can be usable in slicing?)

(deftype NDArray
    [^objects data
     ^long ndims
     ^longs shape
     ^longs strides]

  java.lang.Object
    (toString [m]
      (str (mp/persistent-vector-coerce m))))

;; ## Default striding schemes
;;
;; When we are using C-like striding (row-major ordering), the formula for
;; strides is as follows:
;; shape = (d_1, d_2, \dots, d_N)
;; strides = (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_N)
;; s_j = d_{j+1} d_{j+2} \dots d_N
;; (see [2])

(defn c-strides [shape]
  (conj (->> shape
             reverse
             (reductions *)
             reverse
             rest
             vec) 1))

;; We can easily check for correctness here using NumPy:
;; ```python
;; np.empty([4, 3, 2], dtype=np.int8, order="c").strides # (6, 2, 1)
;; ```
;; An actual test can be found in test_ndarray_implementation.clj.

;; When we are using Fortran-like striding (column-major ordering),
;; the formula for strides is different:
;; s_j = d_1 d_2 \dots d_{j-1}

(defn f-strides [shape]
  (->> shape
       (reductions *)
       butlast
       (cons 1)
       vec))

;; Again, it's easy to use NumPy to verify this implementation:
;; ```python
;; np.empty([4, 3, 2], dtype=np.int8, order="f").strides # (1, 4, 12)
;; ```
;; And again, an actual test can be found in test_ndarray_implementation.clj.
;;
;; ## Constructors
;;
;; Constructing of an empty NDArray with given shape is fairly easy.
;; Here, we provide an optional argument so user can choose to use
;; Fortran-like data layout.

(defn empty-ndarray
  "Returns an empty NDArray of given shape"
  [shape & {:keys [order] :or {order :c}}]
  (let [shape (long-array shape)
        ndims (count shape)
        strides (case order
                  :c (long-array (c-strides shape))
                  :f (long-array (f-strides shape)))
        len (reduce * shape)
        data (object-array len)]
    (NDArray. data ndims shape strides)))

;; Here we construct NDArray with given data. The caveat here is that we
;; can't really use this definition until we define an implementation for
;; protocol PIndexedSettingMutable because of mp/assign! use.

(defn ndarray
  "Returns NDArray with given data, preserving shape of the data"
  [data]
  (let [shape (long-array (mp/get-shape data))
        empty (empty-ndarray shape)]
    (mp/assign! empty data)
    ;; TODO: fix this when default implementation of assign! will return
    ;; mutated object
    empty))

;; ## Helper functions
;;
;; In this section we define a couple of useful functions.
;; TODO: check if NDWrapper can reuse some of this; refactor to
;; utils.clj?
;;
;; First of them is a function to find an index inside of strided array.
;; General formula for finding an element of given index inside of a
;; strided array is
;; index = (n_1, n_2, \dots d_N)
;; offset = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} s_i n_i
;; (see [1])

(defn get-strided-idx
  "Returns an index inside of a strided array given a primitive long arrays
of indexes and strides"

  (areduce idxs i res (long 0)
           (+ (* (aget idxs i) (aget strides i))
              res)))

;; ## Mandatory protocols for all matrix implementations
;;

;; PImplementation protocol contains methods for providing implementation
;; metadata and matrix construction.
;; TODO: check if defining this implementations in deftype's body will
